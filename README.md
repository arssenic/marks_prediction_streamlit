The app.py python file contains all the "training" and "testing" models. The main_app.py python file is the main source file used for most of the web app building part. It contains all the important streamlit functions and methods used.

I implemented this project from scratch on VSCode.

The dataset that I used is quite small only of about 100 students, so the model may not be that reliable but I just wanted to get my hands-on experience on how to build web-apps using ML, Streamlit and many other libraries.
